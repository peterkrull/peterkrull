### Welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹

I study Electrical Engineering, with a special focus on control theory, including full-state feedback and estimation, predictive control and recently computer vision. I have an interest in aerospace and unmanned flight. I enjoy exploring new things, and have come to love Rust for general-purpose and high-performance programs, and Julia for scientific computing. Whenever I am not studying or programming, you may find me designing and printing 3D parts for my various projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Rust-based flight controller: **[Holsatus Flight](https://github.com/holsatus/holsatus-flight/)**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about light weight MPC implementations (see **[tinympc-rs](https://github.com/peterkrull/tinympc-rs/)**)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on GNC projects, primarily based in Rust ðŸ¦€
